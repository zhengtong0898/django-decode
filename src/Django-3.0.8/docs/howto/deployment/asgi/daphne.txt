How to use Django with Daphne
=============================

.. highlight:: bash

Daphne_ is a pure-Python ASGI server for UNIX, maintained by members of the
Django project. It acts as the reference server for ASGI.

.. _Daphne: https://pypi.org/project/daphne/

Installing Daphne
===================

You can install Daphne with ``pip``::

    python -m pip install daphne

Running Django in Daphne
========================

When Daphne is installed, a ``daphne`` command is available which starts the
Daphne server process. At its simplest, Daphne needs to be called with the
location of a module containing an ASGI application object, followed by what
the application is called (separated by a colon).

For a typical Django project, invoking Daphne would look like::

    daphne myproject.asgi:application

This will start one process listening on ``127.0.0.1:8000``. It requires that
your project be on the Python path; to ensure that run this command from the
same directory as your ``manage.py`` file.
