Running Django in Uvicorn
=========================

When Uvicorn is installed, a ``uvicorn`` command is available which runs ASGI
applications. Uvicorn needs to be called with the location of a module
containing a ASGI application object, followed by what the application is
called (separated by a colon).

For a typical Django project, invoking Uvicorn would look like::

    uvicorn myproject.asgi:application

This will start one process listening on ``127.0.0.1:8000``. It requires that
your project be on the Python path; to ensure that run this command from the
same directory as your ``manage.py`` file.

For more advanced usage, please read the `Uvicorn documentation <Uvicorn_>`_.
