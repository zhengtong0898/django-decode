=====================
Installing SpatiaLite
=====================

`SpatiaLite`__ adds spatial support to SQLite, turning it into a full-featured
spatial database.

First, check if you can install SpatiaLite from system packages or binaries.

For example, on Debian-based distributions that package SpatiaLite 4.2+, try to
install the ``libsqlite3-mod-spatialite`` package. For older releases install
``spatialite-bin``.

For macOS, follow the :ref:`instructions below<spatialite_macos>`.

For Windows, you may find binaries on the `Gaia-SINS`__ home page.

In any case, you should always be able to :ref:`install from source
<spatialite_source>`.

Installing from source
======================

:doc:`GEOS and PROJ.4</ref/contrib/gis/install/geolibs>` should be installed
prior to building SpatiaLite.

SQLite
------

Check first if SQLite is compiled with the `R*Tree module`__. Run the sqlite3
command line interface and enter the following query::

    sqlite> CREATE VIRTUAL TABLE testrtree USING rtree(id,minX,maxX,minY,maxY);

If you obtain an error, you will have to recompile SQLite from source. Otherwise,
skip this section.

To install from sources, download the latest amalgamation source archive from
the `SQLite download page`__, and extract::

    $ wget https://www.sqlite.org/YYYY/sqlite-amalgamation-XXX0000.zip
    $ unzip sqlite-amalgamation-XXX0000.zip
    $ cd sqlite-amalgamation-XXX0000

Next, run the ``configure`` script -- however the ``CFLAGS`` environment variable
needs to be customized so that SQLite knows to build the R*Tree module::

    $ CFLAGS="-DSQLITE_ENABLE_RTREE=1" ./configure
    $ make
    $ sudo make install
    $ cd ..

__ https://www.sqlite.org/rtree.html
__ https://www.sqlite.org/download.html

SpatiaLite library (``libspatialite``)
--------------------------------------

Get the latest SpatiaLite library source bundle from the
`download page`__::

    $ wget https://www.gaia-gis.it/gaia-sins/libspatialite-sources/libspatialite-X.Y.Z.tar.gz
    $ tar xaf libspatialite-X.Y.Z.tar.gz
    $ cd libspatialite-X.Y.Z
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

.. note::

    For macOS users building from source, the SpatiaLite library *and* tools
    need to have their ``target`` configured::

        $ ./configure --target=macosx

macOS-specific instructions
==============================

To install the SpatiaLite library and tools, macOS users can choose between
:ref:`kyngchaos` and `Homebrew`_.

KyngChaos
---------

First, follow the instructions in the :ref:`kyngchaos` section.

When creating a SpatiaLite database, the ``spatialite`` program is required.
However, instead of attempting to compile the SpatiaLite tools from source,
download the `SpatiaLite Tools`__ package for macOS, and install ``spatialite``
in a location available in your ``PATH``.  For example::

    $ curl -O https://www.kyngchaos.com/files/software/frameworks/Spatialite_Tools-4.3.zip
    $ unzip Spatialite_Tools-4.3.zip
    $ cd Spatialite\ Tools/tools
    $ sudo cp spatialite /Library/Frameworks/SQLite3.framework/Programs

Finally, for GeoDjango to be able to find the KyngChaos SpatiaLite library,
add the following to your ``settings.py``::

    SPATIALITE_LIBRARY_PATH='/Library/Frameworks/SQLite3.framework/SQLite3'

__ https://www.kyngchaos.com/software/frameworks/

Homebrew
--------

`Homebrew`_ handles all the SpatiaLite related packages on your behalf,
including SQLite, SpatiaLite, PROJ, and GEOS. Install them like this::

    $ brew update
    $ brew install spatialite-tools
    $ brew install gdal

Finally, for GeoDjango to be able to find the SpatiaLite library, add the
following to your ``settings.py``::

    SPATIALITE_LIBRARY_PATH='/usr/local/lib/mod_spatialite.dylib'

.. _Homebrew: https://brew.sh/
